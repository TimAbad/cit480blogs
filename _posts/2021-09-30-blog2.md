<h1>How to create a virtual machine using Oracle Virtualbox</h1>

A virtual machine can be run on a host OS provided that enough resources are made available to the guest operating
system.  Unlike Docker which uses a container engine to run applications, a virtual machine uses a hypervisor that 
creates an instance of each guest operating system that is installed.  The following guide walks through creating a
virtual machine using Oracle Virtualbox.

<h4>Acquire an ISO</h4>

The first step to creating a virtual machine is to acquire an ISO, or image file, of the operating system you wish to
run.  For our purposes we will be using an Ubuntu18.04 image that can be downloaded from the Ubuntu website.  Images
for CentOS, Debian, and others can be downloaded from their respective sites.

<h4>Create the Virtual Machine</h4>

On the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager interface click the New tab.
On the Create Virtual Machine window input a name for your operating system as well as the type of OS: Windows,Linux, etc.
Select the folder where you want to save your virtual machine by indicating the path under the Machine Folder drop down box.

<h4>Memory size</h4>

The recommended memory size is 1024 MB but we can increase the size as needed.  Remember to check recommended system
requirements before creating your virtual machine.  We will use 2048 MB as the recommended memory size.

<h4>Hard disk</h4>

Next we will select the option to create a virtual hard disk now and click next.

We will select to create a VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) and click next.

For our demonstration we will create a fixed disk size of 25 GB which is the recommended storage requirments for 
Ubuntu 18.04 Live server.

Next we are prompted to save our VirtualBox Disk Image.  Choose the location where you want to save your VDI and 
set the storage size here.  Click the create button to begin creating your VDI disk image.

<h4>Starting your virtual machine and network settings</h4>

Before starting our live server we need to add our iso image location that we downloaded earlier and change our 
network settings to bridged adapter so our server will be available to other hosts on the network.  Click settings 
to access the network settings and switch the default NAT to bridged adapter.

Under storage select to add an optical drive and navigate to the location of your downloaded iso image.

On the main menu screen highlight your newly created vm and click the start button with the green arrow to begin the
boot process.
