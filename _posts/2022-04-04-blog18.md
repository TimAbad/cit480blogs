# Networking on Ubuntu
The example below assumes you are configuring a file named `99_config.yaml` in `/etc/netplan/`
To configure your system to use static address assignment, create a netplan configuration in the file `/etc/netplan/99_config.yaml`

The example below assumes you are configuring your first Ethernet interface identified as eth0. 
Change the addresses, gateway4, and nameservers values to meet the requirements of your network.

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
       addresses:
          - 10.10.10.2/24
       gateway4: 10.10.10.1
       nameservers:
          search: [mydomain, otherdomain]
          addresses: [10.10.10.1, 1.1.1.1] 
```
## Restart network service
```shell          
sudo netplan apply
```

## Manual Setup Ubuntu (This is temporary!  will not save after reboot!)

## To find your current IP address
- `ip a`
- To add address `192.168.1.10` with netmask `255.255.255.0` to device `eth0`, you would type:
- `ip address add 192.168.1.10/255.255.255.0 dev eth0`

## To delete all addresses from an interface eth0:
- `ip address flush dev eth01`

## To bring interfaces up or down use the `ip link set dev` followed by the device name and desired state:
- `ip link set dev eth0 up`
- `ip link set dev eth0 down`

## Displaying and Altering the Linux Routing Table

## To disaply the Linux routing table type the following command:

`ip route show`

# Networking on CentOS

```shell

ip -a to list network interface

cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

Edit your network interface!

vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ens192

Set these fields:

BOOTPROTO=static

IPADDR= x.x.x.x

GATEWAY= x.x.x.x

DNS1= x.x.x.x

DNS2= x.x.x.x

sudo systemctl restart network

```

## Secure network

- Enable the firewall
```shell
sudo ufw enable
```
## Enable syn cookie protection

`sysctl -n net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies`

## Disable IPv6 (Potentially harmful)

`echo "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf`

## Disable IP Forwarding

`echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`

## Prevent IP Spoofing

`echo "nospoof on" | sudo tee -a /etc/host.conf`
