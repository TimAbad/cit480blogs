<h3>Simple Linux Upgrade Script in Bash</h3>
Bash is a command language interpreter.  It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems.  The name is an acronym for the Bourne-Again SHell.
Scripting allows for an automatic commands execution that would otherwise be executed itneractively one-by-one.<br>  
In this tutorial we will be updating our Linux host using terminal commands that are included in a bash script.  By using a script we are able to run multiple commands just by running the script.  This method saves us a lot of time and we will also be adding this script to the cron scheduler in order to run the script every month at 2am.

<h4>Step 1. Update the System</h4>

We will first update our system using the apt-get update command.  This command updates our repositories so will always get the most up-to-date packages.<br>

Command: sudo apt-get update
 
<h4>Step 2. Upgrade packages on the System</h4>

Next we will update all packages in our system that are eligible for an upgrade.<br>

Command: sudo apt-get upgrade

<h4>Step 3. Remove orphaned packages and dependencies</h4>

There are times when applications are removed and dependencies for that application remain on the system.  Removing these orphaned packages and dependencies will free up space on our system that was being used by unused programs.<br>

Command: sudo apt-get autoremove

<h4>Step 4. Clear apt cache</h4>

The apt package manager keeps a record or cache of all repositories that it connects to.  Clearing the apt cache helps to free up space on the system as well and clears the cache of unused links.<br>

Command: sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get clean

<h4>Step 5. Create the script</h4>

Bash scripts always start with #!/bin/bash.  This signals to the bash interpreter that this script should be treated as a bash script.<br>

We also include some echo statements to print messages to the console as well as append to a log file.  After the script is completed we may review the log file and save its contents for later review.   

<h4>Step 6. Automate the script using Cron</h4>

Cron is a scheduler service that enables Linux System Administrators to schedule times for scripts and other activites to run on the system.<br>

We can edit the crontab file by using the command: crontab.  Once the file is ready for input we can insert an entry like this:<br>

0 2 * * * bashUpdateScript.sh<br>

MIN HOUR DOM MON DOW CMD<br>

This is for the minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week.  The above crontab entry will run the script every day at 2am.
