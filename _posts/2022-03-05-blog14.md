<h3>Automate System Updates using Bash Script</h3>
Bash is a command language interpreter.  It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems.  The name is an acronym for the Bourne-Again SHell.
Scripting allows for an automatic commands execution that would otherwise be executed itneractively one-by-one.  
In this tutorial we will be updating our Linux host using terminal commands that are included in a bash script.  By using a script we are able to run multiple commands just by running the script.  This method saves us a lot of time and we will also be adding this script to the cron scheduler in order to run the script every month at 2am.

<h4>Step 1. Update the System</h4>

We will first update our system using the apt-get update command.  This command updates our repositories so will always get the most up-to-date packages.<br>

Command: sudo apt-get update
 
<h4>Step 2. Upgrade packages on the System</h4>

Next we will update all packages in our system that are eligible for an upgrade.<br>

Command: sudo apt-get upgrade

<h4>Step 3. Remove orphaned packages and dependencies</h4>

There are times when applications are removed and dependencies for that application remain on the system.  Removing these orphaned packages and dependencies will free up space on our system that was being used by unused programs.<br>

Command: sudo apt-get autoremove

<h4>Step 4. Clear apt cache</h4>

The apt package manager keeps a record or cache of all repositories that it connects to.  Clearing the apt cache helps to free up space on the system as well and clears the cache of unused links.<br>

Command: sudo apt-get autoclean && sudo apt-get clean

<br>We use the psql command to connect to a remote postgresql database.
<br>-h is for the host 
<br>-d is for the database 
<br>-U is for the user 
<br>-W prompts the user for a password
