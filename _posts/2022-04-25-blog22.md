## Schedule jobs with crontab

If you are on linux you can use our good friend crontab, which is a scheduling tool that will run jobs (scripts) at regular intervals.

## crontab
You add a job to crontab by editing the job list. A job is specified in the following format (first line):

```
* * * * * command
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─── day of week (0 - 6) (0 = Sunday, 6 = Saturday)
│ │ │ └──────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ └───────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│ └────────────────── hour (0 - 23)
└─────────────────────── min (0 - 59)
```

## list

List crontab:
```sh
$ crontab -l
```

## edit

Edit crontab:
```sh
$ crontab -e
```

To open crontab with a preferred editor like `nano`:
```sh
$ EDITOR=nano crontab -e
```

## remove

Remove crontab:
```sh
$ crontab -r
```

## Example

I would like to run a script called backup.sh everyday at 12:00am.  We will edit our crontab job entry and insert the following:

```sh
0 12 * * *  cd ~/my/backup/folder && ./backup.sh
```

This will execute the command every day at 12:00, which changes to the folder of the script and runs it. The double ampersand && allows you to specify multiple commands that will run after each other.
