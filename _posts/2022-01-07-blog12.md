<h3>How to create an Active Directory Lab for testing purposes</h3>
Active Directory is a directory service that centralizes the management of users, computers and other objects within a network. Its primary function is to authenticate and authorize users and computers in a windows domain.

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

You will need several Windows OS virtual machines. For our purposes, we are using Microsoft evaluation center copies of Windows 10 Build 2004 [Windows10] and Windows Server 2019: [WindowsServer2019]

[WindowsServer2019]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019
[Windows10]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise

<h4>System Requirements</h4>

The lab setup will comprise of the following:
<br>Server: Windows Server 2019: 1 instance
<br>Processor:1 RAM:2GB HDD:20GB
<br><br>Desktop: Windows 10: 2 instances
<br>Processor:1 RAM:2GB HDD:20GB

<h4>Active Directory Domain Setup</h4>

Before installing active directory services we must configure our TCP/IP settings under network properties.  The IP address, subnet mask and default gateway can be retrieved by running ipconfig /all on the command line.
It is important to set the Preferred DNS server as the localhost at 127.0.0.1 since our Windows Server 2019 will also be running DNS services.  Active Directory works in conjunction with DNS.
