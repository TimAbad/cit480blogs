<h3>How to connect to a Database on PostgreSQL Server for Wordpress Installation</h3>
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
The following tutorial demonstrates how to test your connection to a PostgreSQL server for an existing wordpress installation. 

<h4>Configure PostgreSQL Server to accept incoming connections</h4>

We first need to configure PostgreSQL Server to accept incoming connections.<br>
 
Switch to Root user: (The # is the prompt) 
<br># su -
<br>We need to edit two files shown here in the image which are located in /var/db/postgres/data13

<br>We then need to restart the postgresql service: (The # is the prompt)
<br># service postgresql restart

<br>Postgres is now listening for all (*) remote connections on port 5432

<h4>Connecting to the Database</h4>

Next switch to postgres user: (The # is the prompt)
<br># su postgres

Use \l to see a list of databases
<br>Use \du to list users

<h4>Create Database (The # is the prompt.  Replace database name, username, and password)</h4>
\# create database wp1; 
<br># create user adminwp1 with password 'secret123'; 
<br># grant all privileges on database wp1 to adminwp1; 
<br># \q 

<h4>Test remote connection to our newly created database</h4>

<br>We use the psql command to connect to a remote postgresql database.
<br>-h is for the host 
<br>-d is for the database 
<br>-U is for the user 
<br>-W prompts the user for a password
