<h3>How to Install an Nginx Server in a Windows Environment and deny access to unauthorized IPs</h3>

Nginx is a popular web server that is available for Linux and Windows environments.  In this tutorial we will be looking at
how to install Nginx in a Windows 10 Professional Environment as well as secure our site from unauthorized access.

<h4>Download and Install Nginx Server for Windows</h4>

To install nginx/Windows we first have to download the latest version distribution since this branch of nginx contains all known fixes: [nginx]

[nginx]: http://nginx.org/en/download.html

<h4>Extract Nginx archive and Start Nginx</h4>

In this demonstration we have downloaded the nginx zip file and placed it in our C:\ drive.

<blockquote>
cd c:\
<br>unzip nginx-1.21.4.zip
<br>cd nginx-1.21.4
<br>start nginx
</blockquote>

<h4>Useful commands to know</h4>

Note:Remember to check Task Manager whether you are running multiple instances of Nginx!

<blockquote>
nginx -s stop fast shutdown
<br>nginx -s quit graceful shutdown
<br>nginx -s reload changing configuration, starting new worker processes with a new configuration, graceful shutdown of old worker processes
<br>nginx -s reopen re-opening log files
</blockquote>

<h4>Securing your Nginx Site</h4>

In order to deny access to unauthorized ips we will have to edit Nginx's configuration file named nginx.conf.  In the server block
we can specify an ip address to block or an entire range by using the following syntax:

<blockquote>
deny 192.168.1.64; or deny 192.168.1.0/24
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
server {
        <br>listen       80;
        <br>server_name  localhost;
        <br>deny 192.168.1.64;

        <br>location / {
           <br> root   html;
            <br>index  index.html index.htm;
        <br>}
</blockquote>
